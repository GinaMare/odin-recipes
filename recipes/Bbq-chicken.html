    <h1>Crockpot Barbecue Chicken</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe is for a simple barbecue chicken that can be made in a crock pot. Ideally eaten on sandwich buns with a side of coleslaw or potato salad.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 cup BBQ sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Italian dressing</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken breast lightly ( a small pinch per breast) with some sea salt and place in your crockpot.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl combine BBQ sauce, Italian dressing, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour over chicken, cover and cook on HIGH for 3-4 hours.</li>
        <li>Once time is up, you can serve the breast whole, or shred with 2 forks. If shredding, recover and let cook in sauce for about 10-15 more minutes to soak up all that delish flavor.</li>
        <li>Serve on buns, over rice, in wraps, on a salad or eat a plateful as is! Our favorite way is on fresh rolls, topped with coleslaw.</li>
    </ol>
